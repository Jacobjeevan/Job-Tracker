# Job Tracker

Objective: Build a job tracker app to keep track jobs I have applied to (and learn React/Redux).

An earlier version of this project was built using Django (frontend and backend), which is alive at jobtracker-django.herokuapp.com.

This version aims to rebuild the project (keeping Django for Frontend, but rebuilding it with REST API for backend, and React for frontend).

## Deployments:

[Django with REST backend with React Frontend](https://jobtracker-react.herokuapp.com/)
[Django backend with Django Frontend](https://jobtracker-django.herokuapp.com/)

### Progress:

- [x] Django with REST API
- [x] React for frontend as well as Redux for state management
  - [x] Add job form
